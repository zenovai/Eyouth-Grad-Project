### Data Cleaning

- Unpivoted the line downtime table.
    
- Remodeled the data.
    
- Added shift hours, time of day, batch time, and downtime columns in line productivity.

### Insights:

1. Cola is our most produced product, having 15 total batches, whereas Orange is the least with only 1 batch. Charlie and Dee worked on the most batches (11 each).
    
2. The top factors affecting downtime are machine adjustment, machine failure, and inventory shortage. 55.91% of total downtime is caused by operator errors, which need to be investigated.
    
3. Most of the downtime occurred during the production of Cola.
    
4. Dennis is our least effective worker with the least hours worked as well and should be investigated, while Charlie is our most effective worker with the most worked hours.
    
5. Most of the downtime occurs during noon, with the least during the night.
    
6. Orange's efficiency is well below 50% and needs to be investigated.
    
7. The most occurring downtime factors are machine adjustment, machine failure, and inventory shortage.
    
8. Factors with the most downtime are also the most occurring and, therefore, need to be investigated and fixed as soon as possible.
    
9. The drop in efficiency throughout the day isn't alarming but needs to be checked.
